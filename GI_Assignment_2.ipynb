To manufacture each unit of A and B, the following quantities ar required: Each unit of A requires 1 unit of Milk and 3 units of Choco Each unit of B requires 1 unit of Milk and 2 units of Choco The company kitchen has a total of 5 units of Milk and 12 units of Choco. On each sale, the company makes a profit of Rs 6 per anit A sold and Rs 5 per unit B sold. Now, the company wishes to maximize its profit. How many units of A and B should it produce respectively?  "
